# DFS-BFS
Depth First &amp; Breadth First Search graph 

Graph Algorithms
The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix.
"Traversal works by supplying BFS and DFS the starting node to begin graph traversal.
This algorithm implementation will work for graphs with NO cycles.
When constructing your graph, please use 0 as the starting vertex (node).
You have nodes 0-9 available to construct a graph.
